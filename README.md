# Network-CV

About
-----
* Python implementation of the backend analysis workflow, which is introduced in the paper below:
  
  * Lu et al., "Visual Analytics of Multivariate Networks with Representation Learning and Composite Variable Construction." Journal of Visual Informatics, forthcoming. The preprint version will be released soon.

* As shown in the above example, the two-class density scatterplot allows us to see the density and class distribution at the same time.

Requirements
-----
* Python 3
* Tested on MacOS 12.0.1 (Monterey)

How to cite
